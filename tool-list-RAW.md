Digital Tabletop Software:

Roll20- My favorite virtual table top at the moment.

Token Stamp 2 - Quick and easy way for me to create tokens for my online games.

Hero Forge - I use the online creator to build my character portraits, but you can also order them as miniatures.

Campaign Outlining/Wiki Site:

World Anvil - Currently what I'm using because it has an interactive map that I can drop pins into the world to give better geographic information to my players.

Obsidian Portal - My old outlining website I used years ago.

Audio:

SoundPad- Soundscapes that you can modify and share with players. Such as by tossing in sound effects and ambient noise.

Random Generator Tools:

Talk to Transformer - Text generator, great for building a somewhat coherent script if you need. I have used this for generating news articles and reports in my game to decent effect.

Fake Person Generator - Generates a random person complete with personal information such as family, work, and much more.

This Person Does Not Exist - Generates a random face of a person. Great if you want to have an image for a person, but don't want to worry about using someone's actual photo or artwork.

Donjon - I used this back when I played D&D to generate maps and loot.

We use:

Roll20 for the map

Zoom for face-to-face stuff

Google Docs to store campaign notes. I've got a bunch of stuff, here, from the text I read to players, house rules, the history of the campaign, and the GM's description of the world

Telegram for anything that needs to be texted (I know Roll20 has a really good feature for this but we were using Telegram before Roll20 and we didn't want to change things up.

For GURPS, specifically

GURPS Character Sheet for the players to keep track of their characters.

Combat Accountant (it's my own Python code) for keeping track of who's fighting whom, what everyone's holding, what are the current HP / FP, etc. levels, what spells are going on, whose initiative is it, etc. It even has code to compare the players' GCS sheets against its own database.

For D&D, specifically:

DndBeyond to keep track of the characters

WorldAnvil to keep track of the world

Virtual tabletop: Foundry (preferred where it have system support), Roll20, Discord (just rolls where more isn't needed)

Campaign notes: kanka.io for general documentation, diagrams.net for creating flowcharts

Communication: Discord

Amateur artistry: Gimp, Inkscape

Medium: Discord Voice. tried to get my players to use something else, but they are resistant to change

Digital Tabletop: Screencast GIMP where i have the dungeon drawn as a multi-layered image, where i can move player portraits around

Audio: Groovybot. I just find a new song before every session and loop it the whole session. Sometimes I cut clips out of creepy songs and loop that short clip.

Random Generators: Dwarf Fortress Adventure Mode Character Creation menu. Just keep cycling backgrounds and races.
